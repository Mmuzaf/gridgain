 * Defines {@code alias} for {@link org.apache.ignite.internal.util.lang.IgniteReducer3} by extending it. Since Java doesn't provide type aliases
 * (like Scala, for example) we resort to these types of measures. This is intended to provide for more
 * concise code in cases when readability won't be sacrificed. For more information see {@link org.apache.ignite.internal.util.lang.IgniteReducer3}.
 * @param <E1> Type of the free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called or closed on.
